            <h3>Here's a timeline of Sardal Patel's life:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><b>1875 -</b> Born in Nadiad, Gujarat</li>
              <li><b>1917 -</b> Patel gave a speech in Borsad in September 1917, encouraging Indians nationwide to sign Gandhi's petition demanding Swaraj—self-rule—from Britain.</li>
              <li><b>1938 -</b> In 1938, Patel organised rank and file opposition to the attempts of then-Congress president Subhas Chandra Bose to move away from Gandhi's principles of non-violent resistance.</li>
              <li><b>1946 -</b> In the 1946 election for the Congress presidency, Patel stepped down in favour of Nehru at the request of Gandhi The election's importance stemmed from the fact that the elected President would lead independent India's first Government.</li>
              <li><b>1947 -</b> Nonetheless, he stressed that the princes would need to accede to India in good faith by 15 August 1947.</li>
              <li><b>1950 -</b> When Nehru pressured Dr. Rajendra Prasad to decline a nomination to become the first President of India in 1950 in favour of Rajagopalachari, he thus angered the party, which felt Nehru was attempting to impose his will.</li>
              <li><b>1950 -</b> Dies at the age of 75.</b>
            </ul>
          <blockquote>
            "Sardar Patel was known more for his role in unifying India post-Independence but his achievements before 1947 were equally great. He was among the great heroes of our freedom struggle and National Unity Day will now be celebrated every year in his memory"
